        <ul>
            <li>Created a list that does nothing but show off how bullet points work</li>
            <li>Pretended to write something to fill out space in the example</li>
            <li>Decided to do this at 4:00 AM for no good reason</li>
            <li>Forgot to do laundry today</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This shouldn't be too difficult I assume but if you need any help just look up HTML syntax and usage. This may be written in a javascript file but it's literally just HTML contained in one to make it easier to call as a post in code.</p>    `
